# Data-Structures

DataStrucutres implemented in c#. Since there are not many resources to follow data strucutres in c# language I made this repo which people can use as reference material
and it goes without saying that the quality of this resource is dependent on the support from community. So please feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find something
which can/needs to be imporoved.

## New contributors

New contributors are always welcome and to encourage contributions from beginners I have intentionally left methods un-implemented, so feel free to implement them also I have made
a tremedous amount of gramatical and spelling errors, feel free to correct me there as well.

# HactoberFest 2020

This repository was inactive since a long time and since it's hacktober already I am opening some issues with tag hacktober fest but feel free to open as many as you want and get
your free t-shirt and swag from digital ocean. In order to make it consistent please follow below guidlines to open a pr.

## Pull Request Process

1. Star and fork this repo.
2. Add your implementation for a Ds please make sure to add an interface as well.
3. Create a pr from the forked repo to this repo
4. I'll merge your pr as soon as I verify that it is not a duplicate ds (which is already present in the repo).
